for my project my initial idea was to create an app to sort through all your games find some new ones and add your favorite games to a database but unfortunately i spent too much time looking for apis to use and later found out they weren't necessary but the idea behind it was so you could find new games you haven't played yet and add them to a wish list and later on down the line when you find time to play them you can go to your wish list and pick a game
